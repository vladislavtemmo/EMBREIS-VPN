Privacy Policy

    Introduction
    We care about the privacy of our users and provide transparent information on how our application operates and processes data. Our VPN service is designed exclusively to ensure user security online and does not collect any personal data.

    How the Application Works
    Our application uses the OpenVPN protocol to establish a secure connection between your device and the internet. We ensure the protection of your data through secure authentication methods, data transmission, and encryption.

For VPN connections, we use the open-source library ics-openvpn, which allows us to deliver a reliable and stable connection that meets modern security standards.

    User Authentication
    To log into the application, users only need to provide a username.
    The password is automatically generated by our application randomly to ensure anonymous and secure authentication.
    Registration is also done through a secure API, where users are required to provide only a username. No password is needed.

    Connecting to VPN
    To connect to the VPN, an OpenVPN configuration file is securely retrieved via our API.
    Connection configurations are used exclusively for establishing the VPN connection and are not shared with third parties.
    We use the ics-openvpn library to implement connections, ensuring stable and secure connectivity.

    Data Collection
    We do not collect or store any data about users, their activity, or their connections.

    We do not store activity logs, such as IP addresses, browsing history, or DNS queries.
    We do not share or disclose data to third parties.

    Security and Encryption
    We use modern security methods to protect user data:

    AES-128 Encryption: All data transmitted through the VPN is protected using the AES-128 encryption algorithm, a proven security standard.
    The connection between your device and our servers is secured from interception and unauthorized access.

    No Circumvention of Restrictions
    Our application is not intended for bypassing restrictions or other limitations on the internet. Its primary purpose is to provide users with a secure connection to protect personal data and privacy.

    Geographical Restrictions
    We respect the laws of different countries; therefore:

    The application is not distributed or intended for use in countries where VPN usage is prohibited by law.
    Users are responsible for complying with local VPN legislation when using the application.

    Policy Changes
    We reserve the right to update this privacy policy. Any changes will be published in the application or on our website. We recommend checking this page regularly for the latest information.
