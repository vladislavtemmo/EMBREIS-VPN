Introduction

We care deeply about the privacy of our users and aim to provide transparent information about how our application operates. Our VPN service is designed solely to ensure user security online and does not collect any personal data.

Our application is built on the open-source library ics-openvpn, which is licensed under GPLv2. We fully comply with the terms of this license and have made the source code publicly available at:
GitHub Repository(https://github.com/vladislavtemmo/EMBREIS-VPN/tree/main).
How the Application Works

    Secure Connection:
    The application uses the OpenVPN protocol to establish a secure connection between your device and the internet. We ensure the protection of your data through secure authentication methods, data transmission, and encryption.

    User Authentication:
        Users only need to provide a username to log into the application.
        A password is automatically generated by the application to ensure anonymous and secure authentication.
        Registration is performed via a secure API, and only a username is required.

    VPN Configuration:
        OpenVPN configuration files are securely retrieved through our API and used exclusively to establish VPN connections.
        We implement stable and secure connections using the ics-openvpn library.

Data Collection

We do not collect or store:

    Personal user data (e.g., names, email addresses, IP addresses, etc.);
    Browsing history, DNS queries, activity logs, or any data related to users' online activities;
    Sensitive or identifiable user data.

Our application strictly adheres to a no-logs policy, ensuring complete anonymity and privacy for users.
Data Security

We use modern security standards to protect users' data:

    AES-128 Encryption: All data transmitted through the VPN is encrypted using the AES-128 encryption standard, ensuring its security.
    Connection Protection: Data transmitted between the user's device and our servers is safeguarded against interception or unauthorized access.

Usage Limitations

    Not for Circumventing Restrictions:
    The application is designed to protect user data and privacy, not to bypass internet restrictions or other limitations.

    Compliance with Local Laws:
    Users are responsible for complying with local laws regarding VPN usage. The application is not intended for use in countries where VPN usage is prohibited.
