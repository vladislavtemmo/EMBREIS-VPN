Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
We care about the privacy of our users and provide transparent information about how our application operates and processes data. Our VPN service is designed solely to ensure users' security on the internet and does not collect any personal data.

2. How the Application Works
Our application uses the OpenVPN protocol to create a secure connection between your device and the internet. We ensure the protection of your data using secure authentication, data transmission, and encryption methods. To connect to the VPN, we use the ics-openvpn library, an open-source solution for working with the OpenVPN protocol. This library allows us to provide a reliable and stable connection that meets modern security standards.

3. User Authentication
To log in to the application, users only need to provide a username. The password is generated automatically by our application using a random process to ensure anonymous and secure authentication. Registration is also conducted through a secure API, where users are only required to specify their username. A password is not required.

4. VPN Connection
To connect to the VPN, an OpenVPN configuration file is securely retrieved through our API. Connection configurations are used solely to establish a VPN connection and are not shared with third parties. The connection implementation uses the ics-openvpn library, ensuring stable and secure connections.

5. Data Collection
We do not collect or store any user data, activity, or connection details.

We do not save activity logs, such as IP addresses, visited websites, or DNS requests.

We do not transfer or share data with third parties.

6. Security and Encryption
We use modern security methods to protect user data:

AES-128 Encryption: All data transmitted through the VPN is secured using AES-128 encryption, a proven security standard.

The connection between your device and our servers is protected from interception and unauthorized access.

7. No Bypass of Restrictions
Our application is not intended to bypass internet restrictions or blocks. Its primary purpose is to provide users with a secure connection to protect personal data and privacy.

8. Geographical Restrictions
We respect the laws of different countries, and therefore:

The application is not distributed or intended for use in countries where VPN usage is prohibited by law.

Users are responsible for complying with local VPN laws when using the application.
